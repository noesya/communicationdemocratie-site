        <p>Our<br>societies are facing an unprecedented ecological, social and<br>democratic crisis. A change of model is necessary, and the impacts of<br>climate change requires us to implement these changes without delay.</p><p>Major<br>economic interests, partly responsible for this systemic crisis, are<br>relying on a communications industry that for too long has been<br>precisely designed to foster and increase their influence.</p><p>Having<br>control over the various<br>channels of communication<br>has always been a major political issue. Today, more than ever, it<br>is imperative<br>that we reappropriate these channels of communication. Rebuilding the<br>communications society from the ground up can and must contribute to<br>the transformation of our model<br>of society.</p>

        <p>How<br>can we reclaim the communications society? By controlling the<br>commercial and political influence of big business and redistributing<br>the means of communication to a wider range of stakeholders.</p><p>Why<br>do we need to do this? In order to contribute to the emergence of a<br>“post-growth” economic system that is both ecologically<br>sustainable and socially equitable, respectful of human rights and of<br>the environment. It will also foster more effective democracy, by<br>giving citizens real control over political decisions.</p>

        <p>Remaking<br>communication as a tool in the service of democracy requires us to go<br>further: the very economic model of the media - of the information<br>and cultural industries - will have to evolve towards greater<br>independence, particularly in terms of its relationship with brands.</p><p>Refounding<br>the communications society also calls for rebuilding the<br>communications sector: by training more responsible professionals and<br>fostering the activities of those who are committed to promoting the<br>public interest.</p>

        <p>A<br>new communications society can help nurture a socio-economic model<br>that is more fair and more sustainable, one that places the<br>preservation of people's well-being and social cohesion at its core,<br>and ensures a more equitable participation of non-economic interests<br>in the public and media debate.</p><p>Today,<br>the historic cultural battle between economic interests and the<br>public interest is intensifying. The reappropriation of the means of<br>communication must also contribute, in the long term, to reversing<br>the current power play and forces in the field, in order to catalyse<br>victories for citizen’s struggles. <br></p>
