        <p><br>Over the centuries, <i>information<br></i>and<br><i>communication<br></i>have<i><br></i>given<br>rise to real economic and professional sectors, on an industrialized<br>scale. On the one hand, the <i>telecommunications<br>sector </i>organizes<br>the massive storage and rapid transmission of information; on the<br>other hand, the <i>information<br>and entertainment media sector </i>as<br>well as the <i>cultural<br>industries </i>organize<br>the production and circulation of <i>meaning</i>.<br>Their semantic statements can be about current events, politics,<br>knowledge and learning, or literature and the arts. Together, these<br>industries feed a large part of the informational fabric that gives<br>consistence to human cultures. <br></p><p><br>On top of this, the <i>media<br></i>and<br><i>cultural<br>industries </i>are<br>the historical pillars of the construction of <i>audiences,<br></i>made<br>up of people who find an interest in their semantic contents<i>:<br></i>readers,<br>listeners and viewers. But it was during the 20th century, on the<br>back of the telecommunications sector, that media started to attract<br>more and more massive audiences and an influencer industry truly<br>emerged. It increased the access of companies to these audiences and<br>deepened the know-how linked to shaping <i>persuasive<br>messages. </i>These<br>"communication agencies" grew<br>by selling the production and distribution of influence campaigns to<br>companies, targeting specific client populations.</p><p><br><i>Advertising<br>agencies </i>quickly<br>prospered by renting out to certain media the access to their<br>audiences: selling advertising space and time as well as editorial<br>and cultural contents, in order to broadcast precisely calibrated<br>promotional messages. They then instituted<br>their own broadcasting capacities outside the media: advertising in<br>the public space and in the private spaces of individuals' and<br>families' homes.<br><br></p><p><br>For their<br>part, <i>public<br>relations </i>(PR)<br><i>agencies<br></i>have<br>developed strategies to ensure that their content is directly picked<br>up by the news media, by creating and staging news events about the<br>company and its products. Finally, other structures, often called<br>"firms" or “advisers", have specialized in <i>political<br>influence </i>and<br><i>lobbying<br>activities targeting institutions</i>,<br>to advocate for/defend the interests of their clients, mainly the<br>economic interests of companies.</p><p><br>Together, the professionals of these agencies – advertising,<br>public relations and lobbying – as well as their increasingly<br>numerous interlocutors within companies, have gradually formed the<br><i>communication<br>sector</i>.</p>

        <p><br>When<br>they pursue commercial objectives – to increase product sales –<br>advertising and PR operations aim to reach citizens in all spaces of<br>society, to inform them about new products, to make them aware of<br>novelties and to arouse their <i>desire<br>to consume</i>.<br>With<br>the complementary activities of <i>promotional<br>marketing, </i>conducted<br>directly in homes and at points of sale<i>,<br></i>companies<br>have gradually learned to extend their influence campaigns in such a<br>way as to not just <i>entice</i><br>but to trigger the <i>act<br>of purchase</i>.<br><br></p><p><br>Together, all these activities form <i>commercial<br>communication</i>,<br>which supported the economic and cultural development of the consumer<br>society, first in the United States and then in Western Europe and<br>Japan.</p><p><br>The<br>existence of this model is dependent on maintaining a high <i>level<br>of household consumption. </i>It<br>was developed in the mid-20th century, in industrialized countries in<br>which populations were still relatively exposed to a certain<br>frugality/scarcity in the product offering. Back then the awareness<br>of climate change and its consequences had also not yet taken hold.<br>Commercial communication developed in a context of strong "<i>economic<br>growth", </i>which<br>was<i><br></i>already<br>generating pollution – although much less than today in terms of<br>volume - but which offered an undeniable rise in the standard of<br>living, including through consumer goods and household equipment: the<br>widespread introduction and generalization of consumer goods like the<br>refrigerator, the washing machine, the television and the car among<br>others. At that time, this process was part of an economy marked by<br>full employment. It was also part of a context of reduced inequality<br>and, for large populations, an increased leisure time.</p><p><br>However, the "<i>needs"<br></i>of<br>individuals are not indefinitely extensible, nor are the physical<br>limits of the planet. After a few decades of prosperity - a period<br>known as the "<i>Trente<br>Glorieuses</i>"<br>in France - maintaining a high level of household consumption and<br>consumer demand has become increasingly difficult. At various levels<br>in the industrialized countries, economic growth started slowing down<br>and mass unemployment was taking hold. In order to maintain high<br>consumer demand, industries and merchants embarked on a headlong rush<br>of commercial communication. That was half a century ago.</p><p><br>Finally, the neoliberal revolution initiated by the great powers in<br>the 1980s is characterized by the global deregulation of trade and<br>finance. This context was going to facilitate the investments of the<br>dominant companies in the field of communication, as well as the<br>all-out development of influence activities implemented by the<br>communication sector, which has since never stopped growing. In less<br>than two decades, the world witnessed a <i>hyper-concentration<br>of the globalized economy</i><br>between a few thousand <i>industrial,<br>commercial and financial conglomerates</i>.<br>Today, the majority of these multinationals are developing their own<br>brand strategies, and they rely on a handful of international groups<br>that dominate the communication and influence sector.</p>

        <p><br>In order to sell goods that are increasingly superfluous, the<br>industry has relied on persuasion methods that are ever more<br>effective but often more problematic. <i>Neuromarketing<br></i>techniques,<br>which focus on the <i>behavioral<br>determinants of the individual, </i>have<i><br></i>been<br>perfected by targeting their action on the emotions or <i>cognitive<br>biases </i>of<br>individuals, in particular to affect the brain at subconscious level,<br>for example via the <i>biological<br>reward system</i>.<br>At the same time, advertising has endeavored to anchor the desire and<br>the acquisition of consumer goods in deeper socio-cultural dynamics,<br>and in class relations within the population, in order to develop<br><i>brand<br>communities</i>.<br><br></p><p><br>More broadly, commercial communication has exploited the principle<br>of fashion trends in order to push consumerism into a cycle of<br>intensive growth: it has reinforced its strategies around the ideas<br>of <i>marketing<br>obsolescence</i>.<br>In other words, it has articulated, in the advertising narrative<br>around "novelty", <i>industrial<br>strategies of design and gadget innovation</i><br>in order to provoke an accelerated cycle of product renewal even when<br>the old ones still work.</p><p><br>In the last few decades, <i>the<br>massification of the advertising market </i>has<br>been observed in all areas of society. More and more private media<br>have developed with a model that is strongly or totally financed by<br>advertising, and dependent on the economy of audiences and media<br>planning. Many media outlets have thus largely abandoned their<br>journalistic ambition and cultural mission in order to cater to the<br><i>ideal<br>tastes of the average viewer</i>.<br>At the same time, <i>product<br>placement </i>became<br>ubiquitous within major productions in cinema and video clips, while<br><i>sponsoring<br></i>and<br><i>naming<br></i>became<br>a central feature of the big sports and cultural events.</p><p><br>The public space, which,<br>unlike the media, cannot be bypassed, is also affected, with the<br>multiplication of displays in the streets and in various places where<br>people pass through (train stations, subways, etc.): posters, digital<br>screens, giant billboards hanging from buildings, including<br>historical monuments as has become commonplace in France. Since the<br>2000s, in France, brands are even present in schools and curricula.</p><p><br>Today, there are few human beings who have not been exposed daily,<br>since their childhood, to thousands of <i>advertising<br>messages and commercial stimuli</i>.<br>The economy of well-being shows that these high levels of advertising<br>pressure have impact on society and its members.</p><p><br>They<br>negatively affect consumers' sense of satisfaction and, by<br>reinforcing only the so-called <i>extrinsic<br></i>values<br>of populations, go against the stimulation of empathy and solidarity<br>among individuals.</p><p><br>Deregulated and at the service of the big brands, the communication<br>sector deploys a range of commercial influences that play a direct<br>role in the organization of the <i>mass<br>over consumption</i><br>global phenomenon including in economic sectors (or products) that<br>are particularly polluting or have negative impacts on our health. In<br>this way, in the context of deregulated capitalism, the commercial<br>influence of large companies makes it possible to perpetuate a model<br>of overproduction, leading to the depletion of natural resources, the<br>massive emission of CO<sub>2</sub><br>into the atmosphere and the accumulation of waste. In other words,<br>the commercial influence of the multinationals allows the maintenance<br>of an unsustainable consumerist and productivist model, that is at<br>the origin of the present environmental and climate crisis.</p>

        <p><br>The intensification of the debate around ecological and<br>international solidarity issues at the turn of the millennium has led<br>to the development of <i>voluntary,<br></i>non-binding<br><i>commitments<br></i>by<br>private actors, based on the narrative of <i>corporate<br>social responsibility (CSR). </i><br></p><p><br>Inspired by the ideological narrative of "<i>sustainable<br>development"</i>,<br><i>CSR<br>narratives </i>are<br>often inserted into commercial campaigns, in order to highlight the<br>social or environmental qualities attributed to products, sometimes<br>extended to their production process. But these CSR narratives are<br>also widely applied to so-called <i>"corporate"<br></i>or<br>"<i>institutional"<br></i>communication<br>strategies<i>,<br></i>which<br>focus on the <i>image<br>of the </i>company<br>itself, on the <i>reputation<br></i>of<br>its brand beyond its various products. In this context, for-profit<br>companies publicly attribute <i>societal<br>missions </i>to<br>themselves and stage a news story around their alleged benefits.</p><p><br>Without real control regarding the <i>conformity<br>of these claims with reality</i>,<br>the CSR narrative on the commercial level can mislead<br><i>consumers-citizens</i>,<br>to the detriment of a possibly more virtuous offer. The CSR narrative<br>that companies also develop at the corporate level can, for their<br>part, create an <i>informational<br>fog </i>likely<br>to drown out other information, such as documented denunciations of<br>their real practices regarding human rights and the environment. <br></p><p><br>The <i>whitewashing</i><br><i>practices<br>at image, social or ecological level, </i>organize<br>the opacity on the harmful consequences of companies and their<br>predatory economic models. Through them, they protect themselves from<br><i>reputational<br>risks </i>and<br>their negative effects on the <i>financial<br>value of their brand image</i>.<br>In doing so, CSR narratives take part in the construction of an<br>ideological discourse around the efficacy of <i>self-regulatory<br>bodies, </i>and<br>contribute to the disqualification of restrictive measures introduced<br>by public authorities. The practices of image whitewashing thus<br>contribute to the <i>impunity<br>of the corporate sector</i>.</p><p><br>The contemporary issues of corporate image whitewashing also raise<br>the question of NGO communications. In a rich and diverse civil<br>society, a limited number of large associations, with real brand<br>awareness, undertake large-scale communication campaigns, and their<br>narratives and practices may be perceived by the public as being<br>representative of "civil society" as a whole. However, in<br>many of these campaigns, communication managers decide to call upon<br>the same communication agencies as large companies, and accept to use<br>equally aggressive and dubious marketing and advertising practices<br>(goodies, purchase/sale of personal data, false advertising<br>semiotics), solely focused on short-term objectives of triggering<br>donation <i>behavior</i>.<br>Some also engage in poorly controlled partnerships, in which the<br>benefits for the company<br>in terms of image may be excessive or out of step with the general<br>interest of the operation.</p><p><br>Consequently, devoid of a<br>political vision of their activities and communication postures,<br>these civil society organizations contribute to establishing<br>representations, within the wider population, that can go against the<br>struggles that the associative sector has been leading for a long<br>time. Worse, they contribute to the growing confusion, in the public<br>perception, between the actors of the non-profit sector and the big<br>private economic interests, thus benefiting the CSR narrative of the<br>corporate sector and legitimizing their image whitewashing.</p>

        <p><br>On issues of major importance such as the energy transition, food or<br>public health, the diffuse ideological influence of the CSR narrative<br>can give way to corporate campaigns with more direct political<br>objectives. Linked<br>to institutional lobbying activities, these corporate and public<br>relations campaigns are part of "360° lobbying"<br>mechanisms, similar to those developed by the tobacco industry in the<br>20th century.</p><p><br>In order to move a debate forward in the political arena, large<br>companies buy advertising space and carry out PR operations, then<br>disseminate eminently political messages to the public. Some of them<br>also engage in "<i>astroturfing"<br></i>tactics,<br>staging false citizen mobilizations or artificially generating<br>uncertainty and doubt in the scientific field, thus distorting, in<br>the eyes of decision-makers, the state of opinion or consensus in the<br>academic world. From then on, these companies are in a position to<br><i>capture<br>the informational universe of the political leaders </i>they<br>target, and to control the entire decision-making process in favor of<br>their economic interests.</p><p><br>The lack of transparency and the weak regulation of conventional<br>lobbying is now a well identified political problem. In addition,<br>since the end of the 20th century, the regulation of image laundering<br>and 360° lobbying has become an issue that jeopardizes the struggle<br>against the impunity of corporations and endangers the democratic<br>mechanisms of collective decision making. In addition, the <i>Internet<br>and the connected world </i>provide<br>the communication industry with new and unprecedented means to<br>increase its influence over peoples' minds, both commercially and<br>politically..</p><p><br>Since the end of the 20th<br>century, a socio-technical process of digitization of the world has<br>been underway, i. e. the establishment of a continuous connection of<br>individuals to digital technology. Over the past decade, a shift to<br>the digital age has taken place, so that looking at screens has<br>become the main human activity while awake. As a result, a new<br>advertising market has developed that allows more messages to be<br>delivered to the population, more often and in a more targeted way.<br>While largely additional to the previous advertising markets, the<br>online advertising market has nevertheless put the traditional media<br>in difficulty. It has led to an increased dependence of news media on<br>shrinking advertising budgets, and has caused online versions of the<br>media to increasingly open up to advertising hidden in editorial<br>content (native advertising). The dependency of the media on large<br>advertisers also subjects a growing number of journalists and<br>editorial offices to censorship and self-censorship mechanisms in<br>their investigations of the corporations that “pay their wages».</p><p><br>The digital advertising market is also based on new technological<br>capacities for <i>collecting<br>personal data and individual targeting </i>that<br>raise specific issues, in addition to the direct <i>digital<br>pollution </i>in<br>which this sector plays a major role. The <i>market<br>for personal data, </i>to<br>which the targeting of populations gives rise, generates problems of<br><i>mass<br>surveillance </i>that<br>lead both to issues of <i>surveillance<br>capitalism </i>and<br>to major democratic abuses. The economic interest in collecting (and<br>selling) personal data, as well as in broadcasting advertising to<br>Internet users, has also led to the development of new <i>persuasive<br>design </i>techniques<i>,<br></i>interfaces<br>that actively solicit individuals and lead them to increase their<br>time spent online. These dynamics, all driven by the advertising<br>economy, lead to the development of an <i>attention<br>economy</i>,<br>that preys on peoples attention-spans, brain time, well-being and<br>health. <br></p><p><br>With this transformation<br>of the advertising economy in the digital age, the communications<br>sector now sports the world's largest companies, the "digital<br>giants». Thus, a handful of companies on which the major media<br>outlets now depend have cornered the online advertising market and<br>monopolize the channels that provide access to human attention.</p>

        <p><br>It<br>is by communicating with their fellow men that human beings produce<br>sense, and it is by the communication that they became humanized as<br>thinking beings. Semantic, syntactic or pragmatic, human<br>communication is fundamentally political. It is a precious tool that<br>every society must effectively use to promote social, political and<br>cultural debate. <br></p><p><br>But<br>this tool is now being misused. The communication sector has been<br>taken over by large industrial and commercial interests which, in a<br>context of deregulation, commission and finance influencing campaigns<br>that can be harmful to the community. Today, most communications<br>professionals still have little or no understanding of the political<br>issues raised by their clients' activities, although a growing number<br>of them are now sincerely questioning the practice of their<br>profession. While for-profit companies are legitimate when it comes<br>to communicating information about their products, including through<br>the purchase of advertising space, their communication and influence<br>activities are currently insufficiently regulated.</p><p><br>The rules to fight against the abuses of influencer techniques are<br>insufficient, and those that exist are not always applied. In order<br>to regulate the content of messages, the self-regulation mechanisms,<br>which have largely replaced the public authorities in this area, have<br>shown their inadequacy, and even revealed their true nature as bodies<br>for defending first and foremost the interests of the advertising<br>sector. Beyond the techniques, the media and the messages, the level<br>of advertising pressure on the populations, correlated to the<br>dependence of the media on the advertisers, has now reached<br>unsustainable levels. As a result, a few large non-profit<br>organizations are forced to divide up a few crumbs of the advertising<br>market among themselves, and to give in to the dominant practices of<br>the influence industry in order to achieve equally short-term<br>objectives, while the voices of the smallest socio-economic actors<br>and citizens remain almost completely unheard.</p><p>In this context, the contemporary activities of the influence<br>industry force us to follow an undesirable economic and social<br>trajectory, harmful to the environment, to planetary balances and to<br>our own individual and social well-being They also contribute to<br>weaken our collective capacity to provide solutions to these problems<br>and to change our model. None of these activities are<br>even truly publicly questioned and debated, as a true democratic<br>process would require.</p><p><br>It has become necessary to offer a political response to the<br>excesses of the communication society. The <i>reorganization<br>of the means of information and communication</i><br>has become inevitable, and its methods must be discussed and decided<br>by democratic debate. In this context, a public analysis and debate<br>around the issues of communication by legal entities must contribute<br>to a wider reflection on the communication society of tomorrow, and<br>on the necessary reforms that must be undertaken in order to see it<br>emerge.</p>

        <p><br>The<br>non-profit organization "Communication and Democracy" -<br>"CODE" - was born with this in mind: bringing together<br>qualified personalities on these subjects, coming from a variety of<br>academic disciplines as well as from the communication and media<br>sector, and from civil society. But also people with a variety of<br>competences useful to its social purpose. The aim of the organization<br>is to offer a space for high-level independent analysis. It seeks to<br>be a real place for critical debate on the political stakes of<br>communication, for the animation of public debates on the subject,<br>and for the elaboration of proposals to be put forward to the public<br>and to be advocated to political and institutional decision makers..</p><p>Its<br>action aims to contribute to the re-imagining of a society of<br>communication at the service of the people, cultural emancipation and<br>the preservation of the planet, in which the communication of<br>companies and civil society participates in the ecological and social<br>transition. Its activities contribute to the process of democratic<br>respiration that our contemporary societies need in order to<br>transform our modes of production, our ways of life and,<br>consequently, to change our political structures.</p><p>Institutional reforms have thus become necessary to renovate the<br>mechanisms of representative democracy and to structure the<br>mechanisms of direct democracy. But there is also a need for public,<br>economic and cultural policies that allow organized civil society and<br>social movements to actively contribute and shape the public and<br>political debate.</p><p><br>It is on this last element<br>that CODE's theory of change focuses: the plurality of discourses<br>must be able to influence and counterbalance, in an equitable manner,<br>the considerable communication and influence powers of large<br>corporations, the supervision and regulation framework of which must<br>be rethought and renewed.</p><p>The democratization of the means of communication must lead to the<br>recomposition of the informational sphere in which humanity evolves,<br>in order to enrich the cultural substratum that feeds society on a<br>daily basis. In doing so, this policy is an invitation to <i>re-imagine</i><br>the riches of the world.</p>

        <p><br>At least five major principles should structure a policy of<br>democratization of communication activities: the <i>training<br>of </i>key<br>actors in the stakes of communication, the public <i>transparency<br></i>of<br>influence activities, the <i>supervision<br></i>of<br>products, practices and contents, the <i>regulation<br></i>of<br>contents, and the <i>redistribution<br>of </i>the<br>means of production and diffusion of narratives. <br></p><p><br><i>Training<br></i>in<br>communication issues must evolve, by transforming the curricula of<br>future professionals so as to focus on the political stakes of<br>today's communication, and by accompanying the capacity building of<br>civil society on the strategic and ethical stakes of communication;<br>this last element should facilitate the adoption of communication<br>standards by NGOs that are both efficient for the accomplishment of<br>their social purpose, politically coherent and ethically ambitious.</p><p> In order to make the communication activities of legal entities<br><i>transparent</i>,<br>the details of the expenses incurred in the various media must be<br>made publicly available and easily accessible, and be subject to<br>specific reporting obligations when it comes to political influence<br>communication activities;</p><p><br>The <i>supervision<br>of </i>communication<br>activities aims to put an end to their main abuses, such as<br>intrusive, hidden or polluting advertising media and marketing<br>techniques, the promotion of products whose mass consumption has<br>harmful consequences for the environment or public health, or hidden<br><i>astroturfing<br></i>and<br>political influence strategies and initiatives;</p><p><br>Be<br>it commercial, CSR or corporate messages, corporate narratives must<br>be subject to independent regulation by public authorities in the<br>general interest. It is a question of controlling, in mass<br>communication, the presence of useful, verifiable and complete<br>information, and preventing semiotic strategies leading to marketing<br>obsolescence, image whitewashing and concealed political influence on<br>public debate.</p><p><br>In the longer term, the transformation of the economic and cultural<br>model requires a <i>redistribution<br></i>of<i><br></i>access<br>to the means of communication. In a perspective of <i>cultural<br>battle</i>,<br>public policies must intervene, particularly on economic issues, in<br>order to limit the capacities of advertising diffusion by big<br>companies, to support the independence and the plurality of the<br>media, and to facilitate the access of the civil society to the means<br> of communication. Civil society organizations defending causes must<br>be able to benefit from a privileged access to the means of<br>communication as well as spaces in the appropriate media so as to<br>facilitate the expression of the diversity of citizen narratives.</p><p><br>The<br>organization intends to articulate its struggle for the regulation of<br>the communication activities of large corporations with the ongoing<br>struggles for the accountability of parent companies with respect to<br>the consequences of their industrial and financial activities, and<br>for the transparency and regulation of their institutional lobbying<br>activities. It will support the evolution of standards around<br>corporate social responsibility insofar as they do not substitute for<br>the weaknesses of public intervention. It will frame its work on the<br>issues of regulation of communication activities within the broader<br>issues of environmental and consumer protection, democratic media<br>reform, and the development of a free and user-friendly internet and<br>digital technology..</p><p><br>Just as democracy is a<br>process to be constantly protected and deepened, the mission of<br>“Communication and Democracy» should be structured on a permanent<br>basis, and will undoubtedly diversify and evolve with the changing<br>historical context. Nevertheless, the first constitutive elements of<br>the communication society we are calling for could emerge relatively<br>quickly.</p><p><br>Our medium-term objective<br>is that the action of Communication and Democracy will have<br>contributed to the fact that people in general, and political<br>decision-makers in particular, are no longer subjected to the most<br>aggressive influence devices, and that they are only exposed to a<br>reasonable communicational pressure, respectful of their psychic<br>integrity and of their daily attention time; the organization will<br>have contributed to the fact that individuals are better able to<br>establish a critical distance towards persuasive communication; that<br>it has contributed to the fact that the media can mainly put at the<br>disposal of the people informational and cultural contents<br>independent of external influence strategies; that it has acted so<br>that the citizens, gathered in movements and associations, are better<br>equipped to emit political messages in the public debate, and that<br>they are better accompanied in this by media that have become at the<br>same time more independent, and incited by the public authorities to<br>offer to the civil society appropriate conditions of distribution of<br>citizens' narratives.</p>
