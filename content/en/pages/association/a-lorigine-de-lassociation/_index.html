  The foundation of Communication and democratie springs from an analysis of the historical role of communication activities, as well as from the recent policy failures regarding the regulation of lobbying and advertising activities in France and in Europe.

  The organization &quot;Communication et démocratie&quot; was founded in July 2021 by Alan Ouakrat, a researcher and teacher, Céline Réveillac, a militant communication expert, and Renaud Fossard, a social activist specialized in advocacy, with the support of 15 other qualified personalities who participated in its constitutive assembly.
  
  This initiative springs from an analysis of the historical role of communication activities in the political development of our societies, the discussion leading to the drafting of the founding manifest of our organization, a few months later. Another catalyst was the recent policy failures regarding the regulation of lobbying and advertising activities in France and in Europe.

        <p> The organization "Communication et démocratie" was founded on July 8, 2021 by the researcher and teacher Alan Ouakrat, the activist communication expert Céline Réveillac and the social activist Renaud Fossard, following the constitutive General Assembly that brought together 18 qualified personalities.</p><p>This initiative springs from an analysis that emphasizes the need for citizen debate around the necessary policies to reform the activities of communication and influence sector in general (see <a href="https://www.communication-democratie.org/en/l-association/texte-fondateur/" target="_blank">Foundingmanifest</a>), in line with a strong historical trend. It was also born out of a more specific immediate context: that of the recent conclusion of the "Programme Système publicitaire et influence des multinationales" or "SPIM" program, and out of the ongoing failure of the process to reform the regulatory framework regarding advertising, as discussed within the Climate Resilience Act, voted in 2021.</p><p>  </p>

        <p>The <a href="https://sp-im.org/" target="_blank">SPIM </a>P<a href="https://sp-im.org/" target="_blank">rogram</a>, that ran from 2017 to 2020 under the leadership of Renaud Fossard in association with three social movements "Friends of the Earth"; "Communication sans frontières" and "Résistance à l'agression publicitaire", aimed to assess and identify the various proposals surrounding the issues at stake in the different policy attempts to regulate the communication activities, be they commercial or political, of the multinational corporate sector.</p><p>This program led, among other things, to the organization of a symposium "<i>De l'industrie publicitaire aux relations publiques, les outils d'influence des multinationale</i><i>s</i>" (<i>From the advertising industry to public relations, the tools of influence of multinational corporations)</i>, held in May 2018 at the Institute of Communication Sciences in Paris  (<a href="https://sp-im.org/colloque2018/" target="_blank">summary and videos of the roundtables</a>). It was followed by the publication, in May 2020, together with 21 partner organizations, of the report "<i>Big Corpo. Réguler la pub et l'influence des multinationales, un enjeux écologique et démocratique</i>" (<i>Big Corpo. Regulating advertising and the influence of multinationals, an ecological and democratic issue)</i> (<a href="https://sp-im.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rapport-Spim-complet_220pg_mai2020.pdf" target="_blank">full report</a> and <a href="https://sp-im.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rapport-Big-Corpo_Synth%C3%A8se_Mai2020_PBD.pdf" target="_blank">summary of the report</a>).</p>

        <p> Drafted during the proceedings of the Citizen's Climate Convention (CCC - <i>Convention citoyenne pour le climat</i>), which began in October 2019, and published in the press a few weeks before the CCC published its own conclusions in June 2020, the "Big Corpo" report directly contributed to the emergence of a public debate on the issues surrounding the need to regulate advertising, promotional marketing as well as the struggle against greenwashing.  </p><p>Public awareness regarding these issues by civil society, public opinion and part of the professional communications sector was further raised by the inclusion of this agenda of reforms in the parliamentary debates regarding the "Climate and Resilience" Act. Despite this, however, in the end, the final version of the Act resulted in numerous compromises and setbacks by the majority in power regarding the need to regulate the activities of the commercial communication sector.  </p><p>This failure was also in line with a more general dynamic of lack of ambition by the public authorities - or even lack of political debate - on the issues concerning the regulation of communication in the wider sense, and in particular issues like "360° lobbying" and the impact of advertising on the media and the Internet, at French as well as European levels.</p><p>In this context, the conclusion of the SPIM program in the second half of 2020 prompted a certain number of citizens from different backgrounds to take the initiative, at the beginning of 2021, to create an organization entirely dedicated to the analysis of and advocacy on matters of communication and influence by large corporations and organizations: "Communication et démocratie" was born in the summer of the same year.</p><p>  </p>
